Please read these instructions carefully:
In this simulated gambling task your job is to earn as much money as possible. You can earn money by clicking on one of the 'decks' shown on the screen. Each time you click on a deck you will learn how much you have earned (or lost). The screen will also show your running total. You have a starting balance to get you started and, as stated above, your aim is to earn as much as possible. The task runs over a series of trials and you will be able to see how many trials are remaining. Please note, the money involved is purely hypothetical but treat it 'as-if' it were real money, to reflect what you would actually do if you were betting on cards in a casino.
Ask any questions before continuing.
